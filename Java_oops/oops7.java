//Data abstraction is the process of hiding certain details and showing only essential information to the user.
//Abstraction can be achieved with either abstract classes or interfaces 

//Abstract class: is a restricted class that cannot be used to create objects (to access it, it must be inherited from another class).
//Abstract method: can only be used in an abstract class, and it does not have a body. The body is provided by the subclass (inherited from).
